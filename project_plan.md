# SprintNest MVP - Project Execution Plan

## Project Overview
SprintNest is a lightweight Agile project management tool built for small remote software teams following the SCRUM methodology. The MVP focuses on simplicity and clarity with core features for task management, sprint planning, and team collaboration.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js (already set up)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas)
- **Authentication**: JWT and GitHub OAuth
- **UI Libraries**:
  - Tailwind CSS
  - ShadCN UI
  - Lucide Icons
  - React DnD (for Kanban board)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure (1 week)

   - Set up project routing with React Router
   - Create basic layout components (Navbar, Sidebar, etc.)

2. **Backend Setup**
   - Initialize Express.js server
   - Set up MongoDB connection
   - Configure authentication middleware
   - Create basic API structure

3. **DevOps**
   - Set up GitHub repository
   - Configure environment variables
   - Prepare deployment environments

### Phase 2: Authentication & User Management (1 week)
1. **Authentication System**
   - Implement user registration and login
   - Set up JWT authentication
   - Integrate GitHub OAuth
   - Create protected routes

2. **User Management**
   - Implement user profile functionality
   - Create user roles (Project Manager, Team Member)
   - Set up permissions system

### Phase 3: Team Management (1 week)
1. **Team Creation & Management**
   - Implement team creation functionality
   - Generate and validate invite codes
   - Create team joining mechanism
   - Build team roster view

2. **Team Permissions**
   - Implement role-based permissions
   - Allow Project Managers to remove team members

### Phase 4: Task Management (2 weeks)
1. **Task CRUD Operations**
   - Create task creation form
   - Implement task editing and deletion
   - Set up task assignment functionality

2. **Kanban Board**
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality
   - Create task status columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
   - Build task filtering by status and assignee

### Phase 5: Sprint Management (1 week)
1. **Sprint Creation & Management**
   - Implement sprint creation functionality
   - Create sprint view with task list
   - Build task assignment to sprints

2. **Sprint Dashboard**
   - Create sprint summary view
   - Implement sprint progress tracking

### Phase 6: Dashboard & UI Refinement (1 week)
1. **Dashboard Implementation**
   - Create summary statistics
   - Implement task distribution visualization
   - Build sprint overview section

2. **UI Refinement**
   - Ensure responsive design
   - Implement consistent styling
   - Add loading states and error handling

### Phase 7: Testing & Deployment (1 week)
1. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for critical components
   - Perform integration testing
   - Conduct user acceptance testing

2. **Deployment**
   - Deploy frontend to Vercel
   - Deploy backend to Render or Railway
   - Set up MongoDB Atlas production database
   - Configure CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## Development Approach

### Frontend Development
- Component-based architecture
- State management with React Context or Redux
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Reusable UI components with ShadCN UI

### Backend Development
- RESTful API design
- Middleware for authentication and authorization
- MongoDB schemas with Mongoose
- Error handling and validation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit testing with Jest
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- API testing with Supertest

### Deployment Strategy
- Frontend: Vercel
- Backend: Render or Railway
- Database: MongoDB Atlas
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Authentication complexity | Start with email/password, add GitHub OAuth later |
| Drag-and-drop implementation challenges | Use established libraries like React DnD |
| Database schema changes | Plan schema carefully upfront, use migrations for changes |
| UI consistency | Establish design system early, use ShadCN UI components |

## Success Criteria
- All core features implemented and functional
- Responsive design works on desktop and mobile
- User can complete end-to-end workflows
- Application deployed and accessible online
- Basic security measures implemented
